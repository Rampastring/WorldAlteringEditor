; Dawn of the Tiberium Age Scenario Editor
; https://github.com/Rampastring/TSMapEditor

; This file defines the trigger actions available in the map editor.
; The sections are parsed in their order and the actions are
; assigned internal indexes based on their order in this file.

; Each action has a name, a description, and parameter types.
; A parameter needs a type specified for it to show up in the editor.
; Currently available parameter types (go bash Rampa if you need something added):
; Unused,
; Unknown,
; Number (6),
; LocalVariable,
; TeamType (7),
; Building,
; Aircraft,
; Infantry,
; Unit,
; Movie (12),
; Text (13),
; Trigger (14),
; Boolean (37),
; Sound (16),
; Theme (17),
; Speech (18),
; SuperWeapon (36),
; Animation (25),
; Particle (26),
; VoxelAnim (30),
; Waypoint (1),
; WaypointZZ,
; String,
; GlobalVariable (35),
; House (2)

; A trigger action can have up to 7 parameters. When defining types for these, they range from P1Type= to P7Type=.
; If a trigger action takes a waypoint, typically the waypoint is P7 (this is why FinalSun has "uses waypoint" instead of P7 type).
